# scheduling_dataflow_jobs
For a given list of jobs that could be executed using the dataflow hardware, but also using control-flow processors, and jobs that could be executed only using control-flow processors, schedules some of dataflow jobs for the execution on the dataflow hardware.
This algorithm is used in a scientific paper that explores potentials of using FPGAs for accelerating CPU-demanding applications execution.
